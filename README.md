## About the repository
This repository contains all the documents we used to make a CRF able to identify gene names from a text, specially from various abstracts of different papers. It was made following certain methods and features for the training and testing of the CFR in order to obtain a high f-score for the new predictions.  

### Requisites
To being able to test this CFR you must have:

* Python
* Linux/Unix
* The script from this repository
* Training and test datasets

* We only use R to make graphics of our results. 

### Running the tests

Here we show you how to run the script:

```
python training_validation_v1.py  --inputPath /export/space1/users/mpantoja/3_Sem/BioInf/CRF_Tarea/data-sets/ --trainingFile training-data-set-70.txt --testFile test-data-set-30.txt --outputPath ./training_validation_v1.py
```
